## Overview

The terraform-dependency-sort action processes directories containing `dependencies.json` files to build a directed graph of Terraform stacks using a [depth-first search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search) algorithm. It then performs topological sorting to determine the correct order for deploying the stacks and returns the list of sorted stacks in JSON format, ready to be used in a Github Actions matrix. The script can also visualise the dependency graph using `gvgen`.

## Features

- Recursively searches for `dependencies.json` files in the specified directory tree (see below for example).
- Builds a dependency graph from the extracted dependencies.
- Detects circular dependencies and raises an exception if found.
- Performs topological sorting of the dependency graph.
- Optionally generates a DOT file to visualize the dependency graph using `gvgen`.

## Usage

### Example
```yaml
jobs:
  define_matrix:
    name: Define directory matrix
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      directories: ${{ steps.directories.outputs.json_directory_list }}
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Determine order to run Terraform stacks
        uses: UKHSA-Internal/devops-github-reusable-workflows/.github/actions/terraform-dependency-sort@v1
        id: directories
  build:
    name: Build Infrastructure - ${{ matrix.directory }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs:
      - define_matrix
    strategy:
      matrix:
        directory: ${{ fromJSON(needs.define_matrix.outputs.directories) }}
```

## Setup for local development

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip
- `gvgen` (optional, for graph visualisation)

### Clone the Repository and run Unit Tests

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UKHSA-Internal/devops-github-reusable-workflows.git
cd devops-github-reusable-workflows/.github/actions/terraform-dependency-sort
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m unittest
```

### Running the script
```bash
python3 main.py
```

Optionally, the `--draw` argument can be used to print a DOT file to visually represent the dependency graph.

```bash
python3 main.py --draw
```

## Directory Structure

The script expects a directory structure where each directory represents a stack, and each stack may contain a dependencies.json file listing its dependencies.

```
.
├── applications
│   └── frontend
│       └── dependencies.json
└── core-services
    ├── ecs
    │   └── dependencies.json
    └── network
        └── dependencies.json
```

## `dependencies.json` File Format

Each dependencies.json file should contain a JSON object with a `dependencies.paths` array listing the paths to other stacks, relative from the root of the Terraform stacks.

Example dependencies.json:

```json
{
    "dependencies": {
        "paths": [
            "./core-services/network",
            "./core-services/ecs"
        ]
    }
}
```
