## Details

This repository aims to provide a set of pre-configured GitHub Actions that can be easily integrated into your workflows. By using these actions, you can ensure consistency and reduce duplication in your CI/CD pipelines. 

All actions have a Github Workflow that tests the functionality of the actions. These tests are run against each action before it is merged into the `main` branch.
